# Sass Inline SVG

## TODO

- [] Choose name (inline-svg-image? inline-svg-icon? svg-image? svg-icon?)
- [] Determine how much should be in Ruby vs Sass. Should each function (read file, recolor paths, URL encode, format as data URI) be available in Sass? [Prelim answer: no]
- [] Add rest of readme
- [] Publish as Bower component
